## :black_nib: Description

For the Web Apps from Scratch course within the Minor Web Design & Development ([@cmda-minor-web](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web)) we learn about Designing and Developing web applications from scratch without using frameworks or unnecessary libraries.

This repository shows a web application about movies with the API from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
